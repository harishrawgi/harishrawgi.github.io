                        Hari Shrawgi is an MTech AI student at the Indian Institute of Science where he is working to improve the theoretical foundations of deep learning. He got interested in ML during his under-graduation, doing extensive applied research which led to five research publications. Working on sensitive applied domains such as biomedicine and gene-editing, he realized the need for trustworthy and explainable AI. This need underpins his research goal - to develop theory that can lead to more trustworthy AI models. In his free time, he loves saving virtual worlds in video games.

                      <h3>Sample complexity reduction for Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms</h3>
                      <p>
                          Developed a new technique to reduce training sample requirements for Hierarchical RL algorithms. The technique recycles the data collected at a lower temporal scale for training
                          higher temporal layers. The technique is very easy to plug into most existing and widely used HRL algorithms. The techinque was observed to reduce the training data requirements
                          for HDQN by 50% in a simple MDP setup.

                        <p>
                            The CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing relies heavily on the selection of a good RNA guide. The manual selection process is both difficult and expensive. As part of my B. Tech major project, I developed a CNN model to automate this process. Below are short pointers related to the project:
                            The model was trained on over 400,000 data points from approx. 400 human cell lines. The model outperformed all conventional machine learning models which are dependent on feature enineering.

Substantiated the results with a systematic review on 60 NCBI research works and articles. The new biomarkers can lead to detection of CFS through pathological tests which was not feasible before.
